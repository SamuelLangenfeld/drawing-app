# Drawing App

This is a React/Redux app that runs in the user's browser. It was completed as a front end [technical challenge](https://github.com/socialtables/drawing-app-challenge). The basic canvas and brush components were provided. The challenge was to add additional components to allow users to change color input, upload and use stamps, and reset or save the canvas. The app's design was supposed to look as close as possible to pictures provided:

## Instructions

You will need to have Node.js installed.

From the respository's command line run "npm install" to build the necessary modules. The installation can take some time. After that just run "npm start" to use the application. It should open your browser to localhost:3000 automatically.

The app has only been tested in Chrome and Firefox.
